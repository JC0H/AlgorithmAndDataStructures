/*A pushdown stack (or just a stack) is a collection that is based on the last-in-first-out (LIFO) policy.
For example, many people organize their email as a stackâ€” they push messages on the top when they are received
and pop them from the top when they read them, with most recently received first (last in, first out).
The LIFO policy offered by a stack provides just the behavior that you expect. When a client iterates through
the items in a stack with the foreach construct, the items are processed in the reverse of the order in
which they were added.
